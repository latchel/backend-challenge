# Latchel Bookmarks - Backend code challenge

## Overview
As a developer, I have been tasked with creating the backend for a small bookmarking system. Users can save and retrieve URLs from several places and devices.

We must deploy this feature as soon as possible, but as this will be the foundation for all future development efforts we need you to make sure this code is the best it can be.

**IMPORTANT: This application is purely for code review only. This is by no means a functional application. As a result, pretend that this actually is a user-facing, production application, and that the pull request is simply adding a feature to it.**

## Feature Requirements
- Users should be able to save an URL.
    - When an URL is submitted, we should get and save its metadata using [this API](https://my.linkpreview.net/)
- Users should be able to submit a list of URLs.
- Users should be able to search their urls by name.
- Users should be able to mark individual urls as favorites.
- Users should be able to retrieve all their URLs.
- Users should be able to retrieve all their favorite URLs.

## Task for you
Review the code changes below for the following:
- Syntax errors
- Inefficiencies
- Ways to improve the code
