# Latchel Bookmarks - Backend code challenge

## About This Challenge

Imagine that you are developer tasked with reviewing a colleague's pull request. The Overview and Feature Requirements will give context into the goals and acceptance criteria that your colleague had when he wrote the code. After reading the readme, peer review the pull request.

## Overview
Our team has been tasked with creating the backend for a small bookmarking system. Users can save and retrieve URLs from several places and devices.

We must deploy this feature as soon as possible; As this will be the foundation for all future development efforts, we need you to make sure this code is the best it can be.

**IMPORTANT: This application is purely for code review only. This is by no means a functional application. As a result, pretend that this actually is a user-facing, production application, and that the pull request is simply adding the bookmarking feature to it.**

## Feature Requirements
- Users should be able to save an URL.
    - When an URL is submitted, we should get and save its metadata using [this API](https://www.linkpreview.net/docs/)
- Users should be able to submit a list of URLs.
- Users should be able to search their urls by name.
- Users should be able to mark individual urls as favorites.
